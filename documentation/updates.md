## Updating Instructions <a href="#update" id="update" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
**NOTE:** There is currently no migration path from classic Freeform/Freeform Pro to Freeform Next. Freeform Next can be used alongside classic Freeform/Freeform Pro installations if you're wanting to try out and/or switch to Freeform Next. We recommend you read the [Switching from Freeform Classic](switching-from-classic.md) documentation to learn more about the differences.

**NOTE:** If you're upgrading from Freeform Next **Basic** to Freeform Next **Pro**, you can follow these same instructions below. There will be no **update** button/process as it is not required, though you may see the **Update** button if the version number is greater (e.g. Basic 1.0.3 to Pro 1.0.6).

1. Within your EE sites **/system/user/addons/** and **/themes/user/** directories, delete the *freeform_next* folders.
2. Unzip the download package:
	* Copy the *freeform_next* folder to your EE sites **/system/user/addons/** directory.
	* Open the **themes** folder and copy the *freeform_next* folder to your EE sites **/themes/user/** directory.
2. Go to the **Developer > Add-on Manager** page and click **Update** button for the *Freeform Next* add-on.
