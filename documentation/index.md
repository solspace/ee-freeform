# Overview

Freeform is the most powerful form building add-on that gives you full control to create simple or complex forms.

Freeform centers itself around the idea of letting admins and/or clients enjoy the experience of building and managing simple or complex forms in an intuitive interface that lets you see a live preview of the forms you're building. We call this [Composer](forms-composer.md), where almost everything is at your fingertips as it aims to stay out of your way and let you do as much as possible without having to move around to other areas in the control panel. At the same time, Freeform is very powerful and flexible, so there is also a wide variety of other features, settings and options.

Freeform uses its own set of [fields and field types](fields-field-types.md). Fields are global and available to all forms, but they can also be overwritten per form. This allows you to save time reusing existing fields when making other forms, but also gives you flexibility to make adjustments to them when needed. So to clarify, you can create fields with labels and options that are common to all forms, but also override those on each form.

[Email notifications](email-notifications.md) are global and can be reused for multiple forms, saving you time when you are managing many forms. Freeform allows you to send email notifications upon submittal of a form 5 different ways, each with their own content/template. Email templates can be managed within EE control panel (saved to database), or as HTML template files.

Freeform attempts to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to templating. Our looping templating approach allows you to automate all or almost all of your form formatting.

Freeform also allows for [multi-page forms](multi-page-forms.md), has its own built in [spam protection](spam-protection.md) service, and is capable of supporting several popular [Mailing List](mailing-list-integrations.md) and [CRM (Customer Relationship Management)](crm-integrations.md) API integrations, including [MailChimp](mailing-list-api-mailchimp.md), [Constant Contact](mailing-list-api-constant-contact.md), [Campaign Monitor](mailing-list-api-campaign-monitor.md), [Salesforce](crm-api-salesforce.md) and [HubSpot](crm-api-hubspot.md) and more!

Last but not least, included with Freeform is a set of [Demo Templates](demo-templates.md) that can be installed on your site, instantaneously giving you a real-world set of styled, working templates.
