#Dashboard Widgets
*Solspace Freeform* currently includes 1 widget for use on the Craft Dashboard page.

## Stats widget <a href="#stats" id="stats" class="docs-anchor">#</a>

This is a simple widget that shows you some basic information about your Freeform submissions and setup. You can display stats for all forms, or for individual form(s), can filter the stats by submission, etc.

When running into issues with Freeform, it can particularly be helpful when contacting Solspace Support (by just taking a screenshot of it), as it provides a glimpse of your setup and amount of data.
